## Browser-based IoT Example (OBSOLETED by caf_helloiotbrowser2 !!)


NOTE: This example uses a separate Chrome tab for the gateway code, but Chrome throttles background tabs aggressively, and that created unnecessary delays.
`caf_helloiotbrowser2` uses an iframe for the gateway, making it more responsive.


Basic example combining a CA, an IoT device application, and a React+Flux
front end. The device application can also run in the browser using the Web Bluetooth API (Chrome).
